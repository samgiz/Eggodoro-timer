This is a simple pomodoro style clock, only shaped like an egg. Currently only seems to be displayed correctly in Chrome/Chromium (Firefox does not display it correctly)

Made this as a submission for one of Free Code Camp challenges, and I think it turned out pretty well. Hope to make the app compatible with Firefox and other web browsers in the future.
